<PRE>I have just published a more involved example of a sale, which showcases how a 
sale on prescription, the operator and customer work. You can find it in the 
examples section of the specification module under &quot;Prescription Sale&quot;. In the 
course of writing the example, I had to make several changes to the interface 
definition.

* Handling of Operators

The way an operator (the pharmacist who serves the customer) is handled was 
changed. Operators are no more of type Person, but have their own datatype 
Operator. They are now not maintained by the                 server any more, 
but by the client. The server is merely informed if the client sets an 
operator. Here are more details, copied from the newly added WSDL 
documentation:

The operator is the person who serves and advises the customer at the posps 
client. Usually this is done by a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician. Since 
the posps interface is used in circumstances where posps clients are operated 
by pharmacists who are not usually working for the pharmacy where the client 
is installed (e. g. service center pharmacists), a mapping from a posps 
operator to an operator configured the posps server is problematic. The posps 
interface therefore defines no mechanism to query, create or update operators 
of the the posps server. It instead assumes that the posps client has its own 
mechanism for maintaining a database of allowed operators. The operator 
authenticates with the client and the server is merely informed about this by 
the client calling setSaleOperator/setPickupOperator.

* Definition of ArticleSearchPatternCountrySpecific and 
ArticleSearchOrderCountrySpecific

Due to a misunderstanding of how XML Schema type inheritance works, the two 
types (and their derived concrete types) didn't work as they should. This has 
been resolved by creating a type ArticleSearchPattern which contains either a 
country-independent search element or an element &quot;countrySpecific&quot;, which is 
of type ArticleSearch...CountrySpecific. Here is an example to illustrate 
this:

&lt;!-- search by country-independent attribute &quot;description&quot; --&gt;
&lt;condition&gt;
	&lt;description&gt;aspirin&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/condition&gt;

&lt;!-- search by country-specific attribute PZN --&gt;
&lt;condition&gt;
      &lt;countrySpecific xsi:type=&quot;pptype:ArticleConditionDE&quot;&gt;
              &lt;pzn&gt;4479146 8671142 1887991 1275791 1927495 4208045&lt;/pzn&gt;
      &lt;/countrySpecific&gt;
&lt;/condition&gt;

* Other changes

Added element arzneimittel to PharmaceuticArticleDE.

Changed the definition of packaging to be more free-form (use tokens instead 
of number and enumeration).

Changed the definition of operation setSaleCustomer. If the person set is not 
already part of the sale, the server will automatically add it.

Renamed PersonData.company to organization since this name is more general.

Renamed patient, physician and customer to patientId, physicianId and 
customerId to hint at their data type (PersonId). Also renamed 
setSaleCustomer.personId to customerId to hint at its usage.
