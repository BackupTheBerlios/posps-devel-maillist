Subject: [posps-devel] Changes to posps wsdl to improve generated code of
	wsdl.exe
Message-ID: <DAE96EFCFE785241A00B2863182F621E3E992D@svrowa21.rowa.local>

After feedback from developers who use the Microsoft .Net wsdl.exe to
generate code from the posps wsdl file, we have decided to make two major
changes to the specification to make code generation and working with the
generated code easier:

* Changed XML Schema types nonNegativeInteger and positiveInteger to
unsignedLong.
* Changed names of many operations to make names unique even across ports,
and to improve consistency.

The XML Schema standard types "nonNegativeInteger" and "positiveInteger"
were originally used because they were the best fit for the given data,
without artificially restricting the value range. Unfortunately, wsdl.exe
maps these types to the .Net datatype String, which makes the generated code
awkward to use. "unsignedLong" is mapped to UInt64, which is much easier.
The value range of an unsignedLong should accomodate even the most unforseen
applications of the posps interface. Java JAX-WS maps unsignedLong to a
BigInteger, which works well, too.

Some operation names were the same for different ports, e. g. "addPerson"
for ports "Sale" and "Pickup". Since this makes sourde code generation
harder or even impossible with some tools, the names of these methods have
been changed to make them unique. For this, a new naming convention has been
adopted which states that the name of the port must appear somewhere in name
of any of its operation, usually as or after the verb at the beginning of
the operation name (if it starts with a verb). The names of affected
operations have been updated accordingly.

If there are any further problems with code generation, please keep us
informed. We'd also like to hear of the experience people have with other
code generators.

Subject: [posps-devel] Added context element to article search to enable
	sale-specific information in search result
Message-ID: <DAE96EFCFE785241A00B2863182F621E3E992E@svrowa21.rowa.local>

Up until now, the operation Search.searchArticle was independent of any sale. This made it impossible to return sale-specific information in search results. An important use-case for this is to show the customer rebate informations in the search result view, e. g. "1? off normal price". To make this use-case possible, we have added an ArticleSearchContext parameter to Search.searchArticle and an element priceContextSpecific to the article search result. The POS and PS can use these parameters to calculate sale-specific prices.

Subject: [posps-devel] Defining "profiles" as subsets of posps functionality
Message-ID: <DAE96EFCFE785241A00B2863182F621E4986A6@svrowa21.rowa.local>

Since the posps specification covers a large number of possible usages and
even more optional elements, it is a bit difficult to comprehend. It is also
unrealistic to expect (and unneccessary) that a server implementor will
fully cover the specification in the first release. Nevertheless, server and
client must agree on the functionality which must be offered by the server
in order for the client to work. We therefore want to specify "profiles",
which define subsets of the posps specification which are implemented by a
server. Server implementors can then choose to cover any number of profiles.
Clients can ask which profiles a server covers using the newly defined Posps
port and adapt their functionality accordingly.

A profile will define the ports, operations and elements which are required
to be implemented by the server which states to support it. Profiles will be
defined in collaboration with pharmacy IT system vendors. We want to use the
profiles as basis of an "expansion strategy" where a newly developed posps
server starts out implementing profiles for basic functionality. Over time,
it can be expanded to cover more advanced profiles.

The first two profiles we want to define are "basic sale" and "basic
pickup". "basic sale" will cover sale of articles without prescriptions. It
doesn't include customer or operator information. Accordingly, search for
articles must be supported, but not for persons. "basic pickup" will cover
only the minimum set of operations for a pickup. Specifics for both profiles
have yet to be determined.

Since the posps specification has to work in different countries, profile
definitions can vary from country to country (especially in the supported
elements). Therefore, the profile specification also contains the country
for which this profile is defined. The XML Schema type therefore defines
PospsProfile as profile name, a list of country codes for which the profile
is covered, and the version of the profile specification.

Subject: [posps-devel] New port Posps for meta-information
Message-ID: <DAE96EFCFE785241A00B2863182F621E4986A5@svrowa21.rowa.local>

I've just added a new port named "Posps" to the specification. This port can
be used by clients to query meta-information from servers. This information
includes things like implemented posps version, server vendor and product.
Clients can ask the server which profiles it supports. For information about
profiles, see the related post.

Subject: [posps-devel] Changes to Search port result elements
Message-ID: <DAE96EFCFE785241A00B2863182F621E3E995A@svrowa21.rowa.local>

In the course of the WSDL design cleanup, I've changed definition of results
of searchArticle, searchPerson and getNextSearchResults. Previously, all
operations returned the same element in which the searchResultId was
optional. It was only stated in the documentation when it has to be set. The
new definition makes it explicit that a SearchResultId must be returned by
search..., but must not be returned by getNextSearchResults.

Subject: [posps-devel] return type naming convention / updated return types
Message-ID: <DAE96EFCFE785241A00B2863182F621E3E995C@svrowa21.rowa.local>

After the recent addition of the Posps port and having another look at the
"wrapped" document/literal convention for web service design, it became
apparent that there was an inconsistency in the naming of the operation
result elements. Since we are still in the early implementation phase, I
think that it is still early enough to fix it. I adopted this naming
condition:

* Operations which don't return a value return the element "empty" (no
change to existing specification)
* When several operations return the same type, they use a shared element
ending on "Result" (e. g. saleServerDataResult) (no change)
* When an operation returns elements specific to this operation, the return
element has the name of the operation + "Response" (which follows the
"wrapped" convention) (some operation definition had to be changed to follow
this rule)

For an explanation of the "wrapped" document/literal convention see
http://atmanes.blogspot.com/2005/03/wrapped-documentliteral-convention.html
.
