<PRE>After feedback from developers who use the Microsoft .Net wsdl.exe to
generate code from the posps wsdl file, we have decided to make two major
changes to the specification to make code generation and working with the
generated code easier:

* Changed XML Schema types nonNegativeInteger and positiveInteger to
unsignedLong.
* Changed names of many operations to make names unique even across ports,
and to improve consistency.

The XML Schema standard types &quot;nonNegativeInteger&quot; and &quot;positiveInteger&quot;
were originally used because they were the best fit for the given data,
without artificially restricting the value range. Unfortunately, wsdl.exe
maps these types to the .Net datatype String, which makes the generated code
awkward to use. &quot;unsignedLong&quot; is mapped to UInt64, which is much easier.
The value range of an unsignedLong should accomodate even the most unforseen
applications of the posps interface. Java JAX-WS maps unsignedLong to a
BigInteger, which works well, too.

Some operation names were the same for different ports, e. g. &quot;addPerson&quot;
for ports &quot;Sale&quot; and &quot;Pickup&quot;. Since this makes sourde code generation
harder or even impossible with some tools, the names of these methods have
been changed to make them unique. For this, a new naming convention has been
adopted which states that the name of the port must appear somewhere in name
of any of its operation, usually as or after the verb at the beginning of
the operation name (if it starts with a verb). The names of affected
operations have been updated accordingly.

If there are any further problems with code generation, please keep us
informed. We'd also like to hear of the experience people have with other
code generators.

You can always get the latest list of changes to the specification here:
