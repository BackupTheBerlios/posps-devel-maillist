<PRE>Since the posps specification covers a large number of possible usages and
even more optional elements, it is a bit difficult to comprehend. It is also
unrealistic to expect (and unneccessary) that a server implementor will
fully cover the specification in the first release. Nevertheless, server and
client must agree on the functionality which must be offered by the server
in order for the client to work. We therefore want to specify &quot;profiles&quot;,
which define subsets of the posps specification which are implemented by a
server. Server implementors can then choose to cover any number of profiles.
Clients can ask which profiles a server covers using the newly defined Posps
port and adapt their functionality accordingly.

A profile will define the ports, operations and elements which are required
to be implemented by the server which states to support it. Profiles will be
defined in collaboration with pharmacy IT system vendors. We want to use the
profiles as basis of an &quot;expansion strategy&quot; where a newly developed posps
server starts out implementing profiles for basic functionality. Over time,
it can be expanded to cover more advanced profiles.

The first two profiles we want to define are &quot;basic sale&quot; and &quot;basic
pickup&quot;. &quot;basic sale&quot; will cover sale of articles without prescriptions. It
doesn't include customer or operator information. Accordingly, search for
articles must be supported, but not for persons. &quot;basic pickup&quot; will cover
only the minimum set of operations for a pickup. Specifics for both profiles
have yet to be determined.

Since the posps specification has to work in different countries, profile
definitions can vary from country to country (especially in the supported
elements). Therefore, the profile specification also contains the country
for which this profile is defined. The XML Schema type therefore defines
PospsProfile as profile name, a list of country codes for which the profile
is covered, and the version of the profile specification.
